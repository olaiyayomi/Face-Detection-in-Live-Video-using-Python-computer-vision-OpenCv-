# Face-Detection-in-Live-Video-using-Python-computer-vision-OpenCv-
The Face Detection in Live Video script is a Python program using the OpenCV library to detect a predefined face template in a live video stream. The script captures video from the default camera, reads a face template image, and performs template matching to identify the presence of the face in each frame.
